# STAR
System for Tracking Animals using Radar - Sangam, Pragyan'22

# Introduction
In the course of the last century alone, the planet witnessed the extinction of 18 species of animals. A multitude of wildlife sanctuaries have been established around the globe with the sole purpose of protecting and preserving wildlife in their natural habitat. Despite their eﬀorts, acts of poaching and hunting continue to threaten the existence of many animal species. Locating and monitoring the movement and vitals of the animals in reserves are challenging. 

Some of the existing models for the purpose of tracking wild beings use methods like microchips and GPS which require a physical device to be worn by the animal at all times. This is not feasible as these devices are prone to damage, usually heavy and cannot be used for smaller animals. Further, it gives no information with respect to
monitoring of heartbeat and breathing rate in contrast to this proposed solution. Weather is not a constraint and this system can work all day long. The radar
technology gives real time tracking of the vital signs of the animals by emitting waves and analyzing the reflected waves. This eliminates the demerits of wearing a
physical device and the time taken for this estimation is less.

  1. Detect and measure vital signs of animals.
  2. Tracking both animal and human movements to prevent poaching and hunting in wildlife sanctuaries.

This project proposes the use of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar to send and analyse signals to detect and estimate respiration and heartbeat frequencies. Being capable of measuring vital signs(through non-contact methods) and having a wider ﬁeld, it is more advantageous than the existing alternatives. Through its implementation, detection of human activity and the vital signs of the animals in the reserves can be easily monitored.
