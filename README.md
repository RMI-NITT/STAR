System for Tracking Animals using Radar - Sangam, Pragyan'22

In the course of the last century alone, the planet witnessed the extinction of 18 species of animals. A multitude of wildlife sanctuaries have been established around the globe with the sole purpose of protecting and preserving wildlife in their natural habitat. Despite their eﬀorts, acts of poaching and hunting continue to threaten the existence of many animal species. Locating and monitoring the movement and vitals of the animals in reserves are
challenging. Existing methods involve use of cameras, which prove to be disadvantageous because of their limited ﬁeld of vision and range, and poor performance in harsh weather conditions. While microchip implants that use may help track the diﬀerent animals of the same species, it cannot actively locate or track the vitals of the said animals. GPS devices are also not a feasible option as they are susceptible to damage and are too large to be implanted into animals.
The main objectives of this project are to

  1. Detect and measure vital signs of animals.
  2. Tracking both animal and human movements to prevent poaching and hunting in wildlife sanctuaries.
